# Chapter 2: AI Does Not Understand Business

> AI is a very fast typist with no judgment.

## The Lie

"AI understands what I need."

No. AI predicts plausible next tokens. It has no model of your business, your constraints, or your invariants.

## What This Chapter Covers

- What AI actually does (token prediction)
- Why AI hallucinates structure
- The difference between fluent and correct
- Why unconstrained AI invents bugs

## Key Points

1. **Fluency ≠ Correctness** - AI writes confident nonsense
2. **No Object Permanence** - Each response forgets invariants
3. **Invention Is Default** - Without constraints, AI creates
4. **Composition Is Forced** - Constraints make AI assemble, not invent

## The Test

Ask AI to build an invoicing system without constraints. Count the invariant violations:

- Mutable transaction history
- Floating point currency
- No audit trail
- Editable totals

AI does not understand business. AI understands patterns in text.
